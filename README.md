# Stock-Analysis
## Overview
### We used VBA coding to run analysis on certain pre-picked stocks
## Analysis
### While the first iteration of the program served sufficient we refactored the VBA so that it didn't have to run through the nested loops and would run more effeciently.  The second refactored version of the program ran the same data in about 1/5 of the time

## Comparing/Contrasting
### As you can see from the above images the refactored code ran quite a bit faster.  The big draw to the refactored code that I can see is if you working very large data sets, where the nested loops would take quite a bit of time to run through.
### The major drawback to the refactored code is that compared to the original it is more complex and as such took longer to figure out. 
## Challenges
### The main challange that I faced in completing this project was when something wasn't working to problem solve to find the solution.  For example I forgot an S on the end of a variable and couldn't figure out why my code wasn't working.  The main thing that I noticed doing this project was to go slow at first and make sure that the code is working.
